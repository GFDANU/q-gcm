Folder MQGCM_FINAL: MQGCM files, including new config file (make.config) and the new parameter file (input.params).

Instructions:

(A) Substitute all of the q-gcm source code with the updated files from here. 

(B) In make.config: (i) Choose NCOPT and MOI options (if wanted). (ii) If MOI is activated, choose DLAT option; otherwise (for dry model), uncheck the DLAT option. (iii) Choose TMPF (temperature feedback) and PCOU (partial coupling) options, as necessary. 

(C) Compile the code using Makefile. 

(D) Start from initial conditions in the corresponding lastday.nc files (In the folder LASTDAY, for dry (DQGCM) and moist (MQGCM) model versions).
