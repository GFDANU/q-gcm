# Q-GCM system-specific macro v1.5.0
# ==================================

# Compile/link options which you will need to set:
# ------------------------------------------------
# FC = Command which invokes your Fortran 90 compiler (e.g. f90, ifort, gfortran, ...)
# FFLAGS = List of flags for your Fortran 90 compiler (optimization/debugging/profiling)
# DEBUGS = List of strict debugging flags for your Fortran compiler (for testing)
# TPFLAGS = List of flags for building the simplified test programs
#
# LAPACK = Compiler flag for picking up system copy of LAPACK & BLAS
# (alternatively set LAPSRC and LAPOBJ to use supplied source code version)
#
# netCDF information; if NCOPT in the calling Makefile is unset,
# all the following macros should also be left unset:
# NCDIR = Top directory of netCDF installation
# NCLIB = Location from which to link netCDF library
# IDIR = Directory containing the netCDF include file netcdf.inc
# NCDINC = Absolute filename of netcdf.inc file to be included
# NCLINK = Linker flags for picking up the netCDF library

# Sun Opteron-based Linux systems, GCC gfortran compiler:
# =======================================================
# Operating system: Linux nonsuch 2.6.16.60-0.25-smp #1 SMP Sat Jul 12
#    (uname -a)     10:50:17 UTC 2008 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
# cat /etc/SuSE-release: SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 (x86_64)
#                        VERSION = 10 PATCHLEVEL = 2
# gfortran --version: GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.3.1
# gfortran has its uses as a very pedantic debugging compiler
# Need linelength = 80 for getting LAPACK/BLAS from lasubs.f,
# and for some inline comments in parameters_data.F, otherwise
# default linelength = 72 would suffice for the rest of the code
FC = gfortran -std=f95 -ffixed-line-length-80
# Add -g for profiling
# --------------------
# Without OpenMP
#FFLAGS = -O3 -mtune=native -pedantic -Wunused \
#-Waliasing -Wuninitialized -Wsurprising -g
# With OpenMP
FFLAGS = -O3 #-mtune=native -pedantic -Wunused \
#-Waliasing -Wuninitialized -Wsurprising -g -fopenmp
DEBUGS = -O3 #-mtune=native -pedantic -Wunused \
#-Waliasing -Wuninitialized -Wsurprising -fbounds-check -g
#FFLAGS = ${DEBUGS}
# Compiler flag(s) for test programs (usually simpler)
TPFLAGS =
#TPFLAGS = ${FFLAGS}
#TPFLAGS = ${DEBUGS}

# LAPACK/BLAS:
# ------------
#LAPACK =
# Alternative provision of LAPACK/BLAS from the supplied source code
# Set either LAPACK, or both of LAPSRC and LAPOBJ, but not all three
LAPSRC = lasubs.f
LAPOBJ = lasubs.o

# NetCDF:
# -------
# Passing NCIDIR to the makefile and invoking as -I${NCIDIR} there doesn't
# work; the invocation macro has to be complete or null. Hence use NCLINC.
# My version of netCDF for GCC4, with unseparated Fortran library
NCBASE = /usr
NCIDIR = ${NCBASE}/include
# Derived symbols passed to Makefile:
NCDINC = ${NCIDIR}/netcdf.inc
NCINCL = -I${NCIDIR}
# Static library link
NCLINK = -L${NCBASE}/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf
