Please note that this directory /lapack and its subdirectory
/blas contain only the (very small) subset of the LAPACK and
BLAS libraries required to run Q-GCM. They were extracted from
v3.2.1 of LAPACK, dated 17th April 2009, which is still current
at the time of writing (5th March 2010).

The recommended source of source code for LAPACK is Netlib:
http://www.netlib.org/lapack/

Note that LAPACK-3.2 now requires a FORTRAN 90 compiler.
(Do not try to compile with g77 or other 77 compilers.)

There is a useful introduction to LAPACK at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK

If your system contains a library of highly optimised
mathematical software (e.g. the NAG library, or MKL,
Intel's Math Kernel Library, or other equivalents),
we recommend that you link against such a library to
provide LAPACK and BLAS functionality to Q-GCM; that
should give better performance than compiling LAPACK
and BLAS from the source code provided here.

Please read the README file in this directory (which came
with the LAPACK distribution) for a host of useful information
and advice, but note that it refers to the full distribution,
not this minimal redistribution which suffices for Q-GCM.
