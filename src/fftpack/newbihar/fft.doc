subroutine drffti(n,wsave)

****************************************************************

subroutine drffti initializes the array wsave which is used in
both drfftf and drfftb. the prime factorization of n together with
a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and
stored in wsave.

input parameter

n       the length of the sequence to be transformed.

output parameter

wsave   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 2*n+15.
        the same work array can be used for both drfftf and drfftb
        as long as n remains unchanged. different wsave arrays
        are required for different values of n. the contents of
        wsave must not be changed between calls of drfftf or drfftb.

******************************************************************

subroutine drfftf(n,r,wsave)

******************************************************************

subroutine drfftf computes the fourier coefficients of a real
perodic sequence (fourier analysis). the transform is defined
below at output parameter r.

input parameters

n       the length of the array r to be transformed.  the method
        is most efficient when n is a product of small primes.
        n may change so long as different work arrays are provided

r       a real array of length n which contains the sequence
        to be transformed

wsave   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 2*n+15.
        in the program that calls drfftf. the wsave array must be
        initialized by calling subroutine drffti(n,wsave) and a
        different wsave array must be used for each different
        value of n. this initialization does not have to be
        repeated so long as n remains unchanged thus subsequent
        transforms can be obtained faster than the first.
        the same wsave array can be used by drfftf and drfftb.


output parameters

r       r(1) = the sum from i=1 to i=n of r(i)

        if n is even set l =n/2   , if n is odd set l = (n+1)/2

          then for k = 2,...,l

             r(2*k-2) = the sum from i = 1 to i = n of

                  r(i)*cos((k-1)*(i-1)*2*pi/n)

             r(2*k-1) = the sum from i = 1 to i = n of

                 -r(i)*sin((k-1)*(i-1)*2*pi/n)

        if n is even

             r(n) = the sum from i = 1 to i = n of

                  (-1)**(i-1)*r(i)

 *****  note
             this transform is unnormalized since a call of drfftf
             followed by a call of drfftb will multiply the input
             sequence by n.

wsave   contains results which must not be destroyed between
        calls of drfftf or drfftb.


******************************************************************

subroutine drfftb(n,r,wsave)

        to be transformed

wsave   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 2*n+15.
        in the program that calls drfftb. the wsave array must be
        initialized by calling subroutine drffti(n,wsave) and a
        different wsave array must be used for each different
        value of n. this initialization does not have to be
        repeated so long as n remains unchanged thus subsequent
        transforms can be obtained faster than the first.
        the same wsave array can be used by drfftf and drfftb.


output parameters

r       for n even and for i = 1,...,n

             r(i) = r(1)+(-1)**(i-1)*r(n)

                   2.*r(2*k-2)*cos((k-1)*(i-1)*2*pi/n)

                  -2.*r(2*k-1)*sin((k-1)*(i-1)*2*pi/n)

        for n odd and for i = 1,...,n

             followed by a call of drfftb will multiply the input
             sequence by n.

perodic sequence (fourier analysis). the transform is defined
below at output parameters azero,a and b. defftf is a simplified
version of drfftf. it is not as fast as drfftf since scaling

( call deffti(n,wsave) ) from both defftf and defftb and inserting
it at the appropriate place in your program.

        different wsave array must be used for each different
        value of n. this initialization does not have to be
        repeated so long as n remains unchanged thus subsequent

             x(i)= the sum from k=1 to k=n

                  2*x(k)*sin(k*i*pi/(n+1))

             a call of dsint followed by another call of

             x(i)= the sum from k=1 to k=n of

               4*x(k)*cos((2*k-1)*(i-1)*pi/(2*n))

             a call of dcosqb followed by a call of
             dcosqf will multiply the sequence x by 4*n.
             therefore dcosqf is the unnormalized inverse
             of dcosqb.

wsave   contains initialization calculations which must not
        be destroyed between calls of dcosqb or dcosqf.

subroutine dcffti(n,wsave)

******************************************************************

subroutine dcffti initializes the array wsave which is used in
both dcfftf and dcfftb. the prime factorization of n together with
a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and
stored in wsave.

input parameter

n       the length of the sequence to be transformed

output parameter

wsave   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 4*n+15
        the same work array can be used for both dcfftf and dcfftb
        as long as n remains unchanged. different wsave arrays
        are required for different values of n. the contents of
        wsave must not be changed between calls of dcfftf or dcfftb.

******************************************************************

subroutine dcfftf(n,c,wsave)

******************************************************************

subroutine dcfftf computes the forward complex discrete fourier
transform (the fourier analysis). equivalently , dcfftf computes
the fourier coefficients of a complex periodic sequence.
the transform is defined below at output parameter c.

the transform is not normalized. to obtain a normalized transform
the output must be divided by n. otherwise a call of dcfftf
followed by a call of dcfftb will multiply the sequence by n.

the array wsave which is used by subroutine dcfftf must be
initialized by calling subroutine dcffti(n,wsave).

input parameters


n      the length of the complex sequence c. the method is
       more efficient when n is the product of small primes. n

c      a complex array of length n which contains the sequence

wsave   a real work array which must be dimensioned at least 4n+15
        in the program that calls dcfftf. the wsave array must be
        initialized by calling subroutine dcffti(n,wsave) and a
        different wsave array must be used for each different
        value of n. this initialization does not have to be
        repeated so long as n remains unchanged thus subsequent
        transforms can be obtained faster than the first.
        the same wsave array can be used by dcfftf and dcfftb.

output parameters

subroutine dcfftb(n,c,wsave)

******************************************************************

subroutine dcfftb computes the backward complex discrete fourier
transform (the fourier synthesis). equivalently , dcfftb computes
a complex periodic sequence from its fourier coefficients.
the transform is defined below at output parameter c.

sequence by n.

the array wsave which is used by subroutine dcfftb must be
