Changes in Q-GCM v1.5.0 w.r.t. v1.4.0:
======================================
(since I think we agreed that we wouldn't bother releasing "v1.4.1"
 which Chris W. has been using for his Southern Ocean work).

The principal change is the move to structuring almost all of the
code as modules, in line with best practice for scientific software
in Fortran 90. This has the effect of making Q-GCM v1.5.0 definitely
a Fortran 90 code, rather than Fortran 77 as previously.
In particular most of the common blocks *.cmn in v1.4.0 have been
replaced by data modules *_data.F (except for a few small ones that
have been incorporated into program modules). This has the advantage
that arrays which are unnecessary in a particular configuration can
be removed by the preprocessor.
Everything has been put into modular form except q-gcm.F, the file
containing the main program and some straightforward subroutines.
This is an unfinished task which may be done in v1.5.1 .
An extra module timinfo_data.F has been introduced to make time
intervals and timestep information available to any subprogram,
via USE timinfo.
The former included code fragment parameter.src has been replaced
by a module called parameters_data.F .


Some coding style improvements have been generally made. Most of the
previous INCLUDE statements, notably those for common blocks, have
been replaced by USE statements to access modules, with increasingly
rigorous use of the
USE module, ONLY :
option when accessing data modules to define exactly which variables
in the module are needed. Some keywords such as subroutine declarations
are now in capitals, and are matched with a corresponding
END SUBROUTINE [name] statement.
INTENT(IN) and INTENT(OUT) are being increasingly used to define
subroutine arguments.
Many preprocessor #endif statements are now tagged with a comment
indicating which option the are terminating, thus:
#ifndef ocean_only
#endif /* not ocean_only */
The syntax for specifying lengths of character strings has been
changed to conform to Fortran 90 style.
Where possible comments have been extended and improved.


The Makefile has been tidied, restructured and all dependencies
have been rechecked. The Makefile itself now contains only the
dependencies and compile/link instructions; information about the
model configuration as defined by preprocessor options is included
via a file called make.config (which can be a link to one of several
specific configuration options), and machine & compiler specific
information (such as compiler name, location of libraries, debug
or optimisation options) is included via a file called make.macro
(again, usually a link to one of a set of such files).


The small_local preprocessor option has been removed, as it
has not been found necessary on recent unix/linux systems.


A new module qocdiag.F has been written to diagnose the instantaneous
rate of change of potential vorticity (the evolution equation which
drives the model) in each layer, and each of the terms that
contributes to the RHS of the evolution equation. Addition of
this module (and the fact that it was written in module form)
was the main change in v1.4.1, not generally published.
It is hoped to provide a time-averaged variant of this module
in v1.5.1.


Changes to specific program files:
----------------------------------
In general, program modules computing only diagnostic quantities,
and which thus might in principle be removed without affecting
the running of the model, are being renamed as *_diag.F

amlsubs.F contains a bugfix in subroutine amladf, affecting
(only) the N.E. corner point of the atmospheric domain.
Thanks to Tim Leslie for spotting this.

areasubs.F has been renamed as areasubs_diag.F, and a couple
of the long names in netCDF output have been made clearer.

covsubs.F has been renamed as covaria_diag.F
Parameters used for covariance arrays (and set in parameters_data.F)
have been renamed to make them more distinctive:
changed nsa, nso to nscvat, nscvoc
changed nva, nvo to nvcvat, nvcvoc
changed nca, nco to nmcvat, nmcvoc

diasubs.F has been renamed as monitor_diag.F; extra integrals
are computed so that the energy budget can be closed correctly,
and the code has been extensively tidied.

q-gcm.F has more complete testing of velocity fields in
subroutine cfltry (now includes atmos. mixed layer velocities)

qgosubs.F has had the argument list to subroutine ocadif
simplified in the box ocean case, where fewer quantities
for determining constraints need to be computed.

radsubs.f prints out results (mainly various derived radiation
coefficients) to more significant figures (as a check when porting
the code between different systems), and now uses Kahan summation to
compute vertical integrals for the radiation scheme more accurately.
The parallelism previously included has been removed, as being hard
to integrate with the Kahan summation, and of negligible benefit to
overall performance.

xfosubs.F has been recoded to use internal module variables rather
than a common block for internal communication. In addition several
sections of the code have been reorganised to improve computational
efficiency. This code however remains unacceptably expensive, and
in need of further rewriting to improve performance. (v1.5.1?)

tavsubs.F has been renamed as timavge.F, and the code has been tidied.

valsubs.F has been extended to check the validity of ocean layer
thicknesses, as well as having many detailed code improvements.



Later, minor changes:
---------------------
Variables nouto, nouta renamed noutoc, noutat for clarity
  changes in q-gcm.F, outparam.f, nc_subs.F and qocdiag.F
Time interval of printout to std. output (via calls to prsamp)
  changed from the diagnostic interval dgnday to a new (extra)
  interval prtday, necessitating changes to input.params and
  in_param.f, and q-gcm.F
Variables ekeioc, ekeiat renames kealoc, kealat respectively
  (less misleading; these are average layer KE values, NOT
   eddy kinetic energies as might have been inferred)
   also changes monitor_data.cmn
sstmin, sstmax are now computed and output as part of the monitoring
   diagnostics (changes in monitor_data.cmn and monitor_diag.F)
Tidy some redundant variables out of timavge.F
